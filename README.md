WebCrawler is an open source web crawler for Java which provides a simple interface for crawling the Web. WebCrawler can easily get the url, text, links, html, and unique id of the downloaded pageUsing it, you can setup a multi-threaded web crawler in few minutes. It is designed very efficiently and has the ability to crawl domains very fast (e.g., it has been able to crawl 200 Wikipedia pages per second). However, since this is against crawling policies and puts huge load on servers (and they might block you!), since version 1.3, by default WebCrawler waits at least 200 milliseconds between requests.
